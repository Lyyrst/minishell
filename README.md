<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The Minishell project is a key milestone in systems programming, 
designed to deepen understanding of Unix-based systems and shell functionality. 

The goal is to create a simplified version of the Unix shell, 
simulating the behavior of common shell environments like Bash or Zsh.

**Key Features of the Minishell Project:**
- Prompt Display: Your shell will display a prompt, allowing users to input commands interactively.

- Command Execution: The shell should handle both built-in commands (like echo, cd, exit, etc.) as well as external programs. This includes the ability to run programs located in system paths.

- Pipes and Redirections: Support for piping (|) between multiple commands and redirection (<, >) is essential. This enables chaining commands and directing input/output between files and commands.

- Environment Variables: Your shell should recognize and manage environment variables, giving users access to system configurations, such as $PATH.

- Error Handling: The shell must provide appropriate error messages for invalid commands, syntactic mistakes, or permission errors, ensuring smooth user experience.

**Bonus Features:**
- Logical Operators (&&, ||): The shell should support logical operators for conditional execution of commands, allowing users to chain commands that depend on the success or failure of the previous command.

- Parentheses Handling: Implement support for grouping commands with parentheses, allowing the user to execute multiple commands in subshells.

- Wildcards (*): Support for wildcard expansion, enabling commands to match patterns for filenames or directories.

- History: As a bonus, your shell can include features like command history, improving user convenience and usability.

## Reminder

Please remember that this project is one of the first i did as a computer science learner, it does not reflect my actual skills but through which project i learned programming.
